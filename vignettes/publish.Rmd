One of the primary motivations of the `dataset` and the `dublincore()` and `datacite()` functions is the creation of publication-ready data assets. 

## Exporting functions

The planned export functions will create `csv`, `xlsx`, SPSS `sav` and STATA `dta` datasets that contain all [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) metadata.

## Publishing functions

We are planning an automatic publishing connection to [zen4R](https://github.com/eblondel/zen4R), the R language interface to the Zenodo open science repository. The `zen4R` package uses R6 classes which are known only for advanced R users. Our planned connector is a simple function that connects our s3 `dataset()`, which is inherited from a simple `data.frame()` with the [depositRecord](https://github.com/eblondel/zen4R/wiki#ZenodoDeposit-publish) method of `zen4R` for immediate publication on Zenodo.
